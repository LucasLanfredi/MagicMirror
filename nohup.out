[1119:0403/144511.138740:FATAL:setuid_sandbox_host.cc(157)] The SUID sandbox helper binary was found, but is not configured correctly. Rather than run without sandboxing I'm aborting now. You need to make sure that /home/pi/MagicMirror/node_modules/electron/dist/chrome-sandbox is owned by root and has mode 4755.
